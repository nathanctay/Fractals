## Running the starter code
This program has a simple command line syntax:

```
$ python src/main.py FRACTAL_NAME
```

`FRACTAL_NAME` is the name of a fractal image this program is capable of
producing.  When you run one of the programs without this argument, it will
list names of images it can draw and quits.  The same happens when an
unrecognized `FRACTAL_NAME` is given.

Made as assignment for cs class. Equations for fractals were given to me. Was given some starter code as well that did not get used.
